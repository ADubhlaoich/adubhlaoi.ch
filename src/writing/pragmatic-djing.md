This is a sequel of sorts to an old piece of mine, [Swing DJ Guidelines](../dj-guidelines). I still stand by it: it covers what I consider the spirit of good DJing. My intention with this piece is to offer some more practical advice and examples. I have never claimed to be a particularly good DJ, but what I share is what has worked well everywhere I've had the chance to work. 

It's been a holistic effort for me with many lessons learned through failure. My worst set was probably my very first one: there's been some other times technical problems have bludgeoned me, but there's ways to mitigate that, too.

Let's get right into it.

## Finding music

A lot of people have tried to sell me on Spotify as a discovery tool. In principle, I can understand this: it's got a gigantic database of swing music, full of things you've heard and things you've never heard of.

In reality, most people I know exclusively DJ whatever they heard during the last batch of competition videos they binge watched. In certain cases, they just ran over to me in the middle of one of my sets, took the name of a song and beat the music to glue over the next year.

On that note, [you should not be DJing from Spotify](https://www.spotify.com/uk/legal/end-user-agreement/#3-your-use-of-the-spotify-service). You probably won't get in trouble, but you will get sliced at the kneecaps if you ever have to work with or in public.

> _Subject to your compliance with these Terms (including any other applicable terms and conditions), we grant to you limited, non-exclusive, revocable permission to make **personal, non-commercial** use of the Spotify Service and the Content (collectively, "Access")_.

You need to become genuinely curious about music. The problem you should try to solve is not "What music is good for dancers?", it should be "How do I understand swing music?". A simple start is to understand who the individual people in a given arrangement are.

Take Benny Goodman. You probably know who he is, and you probably know he worked with drummer Gene Krupa a lot. Did Benny Goodman write all of his music? How did the composition of the orchestra change, and why?

These kinds of questions will lead you towards musicians you might not know, and ensembles you were unaware they were a part of. You'll end up noticing a lot of people worked together in different arrangements: if there's an instrument you favour, there's a chance your new favourite musician might have lead a band.

Now that you have an idea of how to discover music, you need a way to actually obtain it.

[bandcamp](https://bandcamp.com/) is a good shout for contemporary swing bands (You'll notice a lot of them swap members, too). Sticking to digital, I tend to have better luck finding older recordings on [7digital](https://ie.7digital.com/). In theory, Amazon also has a lot of great options, but I try my best to avoid supporting it as a business.

I built the backbone of my music collection hitting local charity and [record shops](https://maps.app.goo.gl/yA4CGvRR19wt3W4DA). I enjoy this quite a lot: I notice some people buy songs piecemeal on bandcamp; I buy albums and discographies whole, and sort them out later.

Diving through stacks of CDs can be quite interesting, because what you see is what you get. Finding compilation albums is a great way to introduce yourself to bands and orchestras, since they tend to have a large variety. The music itself tends to fall into two categories: whatever the arrangement was most famous for, or whatever the record label could license for cheap.

I don't know a single person who has an internal CD drive anymore, but you can find a USB one for cheap. I use a program called [whipper](https://github.com/whipper-team/whipper) to dismantle analogue music I buy - charity shops have let me build up a sizeable non-swing music collection this way.

## Arranging music

You've got a bunch of music! Now you need to actually sort through it.

Before I get around to sorting it, I add all of my music to my [beets](https://beets.io/) database. It automatically organises and tags music files appropriately, but it's reliant on online databases. Great for popular music, bordering useless for anything obscure.

Most swing music is effectively obscure, so I do a lot of manual tagging. What I largely use it for is converting my entire music collection to mp3 (From lossless FLAC) so I can keep it all on my phone to listen to whenever I like.

I'll talk more about it in a later section, but the program I use to arrange and DJ my music is [Exaile](https://exaile.org/). Most people I know actually use [Mixx](https://mixxx.org/): the best tool is the one you will or can actually use.

Figure out a way to update the tags of your music, and starting adding the BPM as a column. Being able to see the speed of your music at a glance is invaluable, as it's the first contextual decision you will typically make. Automatic BPM taggers largely don't do well with swing music, but you could try [this project](https://github.com/ellington-project/ellington).

Your music player or manager might have a way to tap it in, or you might need to get a phone application. Tap your foot along to the music, and focus on the rhythm section. About 30 seconds a song is sufficient for me, but in reality I will listen to whole albums over and over for days when I get them.

Once you have your BPM sorted, there's all sorts of ways you can tag an individual song:

- Sub-genre of jazz (Bebop, dixieland, ragtime, and so forth)
- Dance style (Many people will advise against this)
- Rhythm (Syncopated, shuffle, staccato)
- Utility (Competitions, jams)

No single way works best for everyone, and much like writing notes for dance classes, you'll probably find your preference changes over time. I've only done BPM for a long time, but I also dance most swing dance styles: I tend to choose music based on the groove, which is nebulous to define and more easily felt.

## Setting up

We're not playing anything yet. We've just arrived at the venue and are unpacking our gear. What are you bringing, and what are you doing before your slot?

I usually show up 20 minutes before I'm needed. This puts organisers at ease, and lets me hear what music is being used in a class or part of what's been in the prior DJ's set. We're not worrying about what to play yet, though.

Here's what I usually bring:

- My laptop, fully charged
- My laptop charger
- My USB mouse, so I'm not fighting a trackpad
- My headphones, and its cables (I usually use it with bluetooth)
- My USB [digital to audio converter (DAC)](https://www.audioquest.com/products/dragonfly-red)
- A 3.5mm to 3.5mm audio jack

My headphone cables are also 3.5mm to 3.5mm: the extra one listed is in case the cable provided to me by the organised or venue is banjaxed. If I expect the situation to be dire, I might also bring an entire speaker with me - but that's a rarity.

The USB DAC is barely used for its full potential: I use it as a separate audio sink so that I can play and preview music on a single device. I line into the speaker directly with my laptop, and preview with my headphones and the DAC.

It's set-up this way so that if someone bumps the DAC, I lose previewing capability - instead of the venue losing music. Similarly, wiring in my headphones means I don't have to worry about any bluetooth device sleep shenanigans, which I saw happen to a friend during a public gig.

I open my music player, do any device configuration necessary, and disable any music auto play options, and the ability to play a song while an existing one is playing. I only want music playing exactly when I decide it should be, and no other time.

We're almost ready to roll. Make sure you have water, and swap into your dance shoes to give yourself the option to get up.

## Planning your set

I don't actually plan my sets, but there are things I often have to consider.

- Are there performances? The organiser will _probably_ have told me in advance
- Am I expected to run a jam? If it's for someone, I will not facilitate it without their explicit consent
- Is there a band, and when will they arrive? Getting a quick photograph of their sets is useful
