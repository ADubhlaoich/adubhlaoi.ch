I put a nontrivial amount of thought into how to phrase my precise question. This thought was out of respect to the limited time we all have before we shed our mortal coils and return to oblivion.

The only reason I needed to ask this question at all is because you or the universe as a whole decided there was a problem I had to solve. If you have all the context required for this quest, why didn't you write it down? Better yet, why aren't you the one preparing to do it?

The question wasn't philosophical: there is no-open ended answer. When I can help it, I try to enable a binary response: Yes or No.

The fact I am asking a question at all means I am looking for guidance, so giving me an open invitation to ask for help is highly redundant: that is exactly what I am doing. Right now, over a public medium.

The reason I didn't and don't direct message you isn't because I'm shy. It's because someone, somewhere, already failed to fully contextualise a problem. By having this conversation in public, there is visible history of my effort to contribute to capitalism in my own insignificant way.

And if a future archaeologist is trying to build a mosaic to solve a problem of their own, I want to save them time with my own Sisyphean struggle as example.

Have you ever actually watched a recording of a meeting? Most of them could have been e-mails. An e-mail would have forced you to think about what important information there was to share. You were the one who suggested I join this meeting. I am the one who suffers you trying to explain microscopic details of a complex picture when my question was just "What is a picture of?".

Every permutation of a group direct message you have brought me into is another dead end in the house of mirrors I am attempting to escape. I try to remember the relevant combinatorics to figure out just how many groups DMs you could force me into, and I realise I don't need to figure it out. I can just count them when you've dragged me to that point.

Please, just answer the question. "You don't know" is perfectly acceptable. Pointing me towards who does know would be fantastic. If you want to talk for the sake of talking, I'm up for that when I'm not problem solving.

And I wish you would stop making our scheduled meetings run over time by using them as an opportunity for professional trauma dumping. This isn't a blamestorm or regretrospective.
