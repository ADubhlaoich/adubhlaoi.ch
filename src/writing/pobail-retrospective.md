As a disclaimer, my opinions may not be shared with any of the people I have worked with in the past or those I work with currently. It's important for me to state this, as some of the things I say may cause offense, or could be interpreted unfavourably.

When I started dancing, I approached it as a skill. I wanted to round out a catalogue of tools I could use as a performer, and felt that dancing and choreography were two sorely missing elements in my repertoire. As a result, I was highly focused on improving as quickly and as thoroughly as I could.

I took on as many classes as I could, starting from one hour a week to eventually land at five hours a week - not including social dances. I was friendly towards people, but I wasn't actually there to make friends: It's a hilarious thing to admit given how social an activity partner dance can be.

Eventually, and intermittently, I started to organise classes and social events of my own. I didn't desire recognition or renumeration; I wanted the kinds of events I desired to attend to exist. When faced with this kind of dilemma, my options are to do something or to leave: complaining isn't an option, nor is stewing silently.

Many of these events went well, and some of them went terribly due to personal and intrapersonal failure. I learned from them, and made a promise to do better in the future, were I ever in a position to do so. I stepped back, and supported others where I could: as a DJ, as a substitute teacher, as a doorkeeper, as an occasional confidant.

Having reached a comfortable baseline for my movement, I could relax a bit and fall into my natural rhythm of observation. I worked on myself, and I asked myself what it was that had kept me at dancing. I realised, after a while, it was the friends I had made.

But something didn't sit right with me. I missed a lot about circus.

## Circus as a Community

When you tell people you do circus performance, or are involved with the community, people usually ask you what circus you're involved with. The immediate assumption is that you work in one of the few big-top circus tents: those are typically family affairs.

The reality is that the circus community is more than just people who perform it professionally. It's the college societies, organising training spaces, workshops and trips for its members. It's individuals informally organising to meet up on beaches to practice using fire props. 

It's groups coming together collectively to perform shows, to run classes, and to plan events as small as 80 people in a hall to 2,000 people at a campsite. What brings all of these people together is a sense of empathy and familiarity. A general approach of friendliness, and affection.

A somewhat laissez-faire approach to getting things done: a lack of drive, but also of animosity.

Everyone is friendly, and there's no real sense of hierarchy. An international performer doing highly technical tricks on a gala show stage will be in the same line as you at the closest burrito bar to the venue. You might end up napping in a pile alongside them the following day. That night, a relative stranger might regurgitate a shot of tequila into your mouth during a renegade show.

The state of affairs is overall relaxed, and although there is deference to the effort some people dedicate towards performing their craft, or facilitating the spaces and events the community congregates in, everyone is essentially treated the same: a well intentioned, infrequently employed vagrant with a heart of gold. You will be welcomed, and welcome in return.

## Dancing In The Before Times

You can more or less forget all of that for where Dublin's dance scene was when I started.

For a multitude of reasons, Dublin's swing dance scene had stagnated for a number of years. It was once really big, then shrank, and maintained a holding pattern for a very long time. There were multiple weekly dances, and multiple drop-in classes, but only one rotating set of progressive classes - and a divide between people who danced early in the week and those who danced later.

The early week dancers were a younger crowd, and the mid week dancers were an older crowd. Some people (Like me) danced on both nights, but most people never spoke to or danced with people who attended the other night beyond when there were outdoor dances during the summer.

The people that ran events at the time either didn't have the bandwidth or the drive to run anything more nor had a specific goal to steer the community towards. However, many people who had migrated to Dublin found themselves dissatisfied by the overall state of the scene.

These were the best dancers - who were also the teachers. That were also the DJs. And also all friends with each other. It was their desire - nay, their duty, to uplift the masses and transform Dublin's scene to an international standard. The conclusion: people needed more classes.

## Things Get Elitist

I mentioned earlier that I had taken my own shot at organising events for a while - I wanted more classes. I was driven in a very specific way, and it followed how I generally approach skill acquisition. I didn't and don't ever expect anyone to approach learning the way I do, especially because it can be sterile and cold sometimes.

Nobody had considered that what they wanted and thought was important was not what others wanted or thought was important. In an effort to enlighten Dublin's scene, the crew involved with pushing it had made it colder. They DJed for themselves and danced with each other - only asking their students to dance out of obligation, and rarely talking to them personally.

This approach cascaded down. People were only familiar with others who were in their classes, and the people who didn't attend classes at all were completely overlooked. The music, the lifeblood of the dancefloor - catered for the "best" dancers with no consideration that others might struggle. If they couldn't manage, it's because they weren't working hard enough.

Friendly approaches to teaching were looked down upon, and perceived as patronising. There had to be a "best" way to teach, to make students internalise the foundational movements for Lindy Hop that would prove their value as individuals and thus drag the mean skill level of the scene up from the dredges. Classes were optimised to homogenise; your swingout is your net worth.

Teachers and students alike begin to realise that organisers are replaceable. Everyone is trying to fix the scene with the precision and warmth of an assassin, identifying problems in movement. For some, classes become an unwanted obligation. For others, an opportunity for social climbing or monetary gain. All symptoms of one, underlying root problem: there is no community.

## What is Community, Anyway?

For a few years I was involved with running tech events. Monthly meetups, a few conferences here or there. We had a handful of people - most of who had been there for years. The same problem, annually - we don't have enough time to do things, or enough people to do more.

I gave up one evening, sitting in the corner of a pub. The person in control of everything had gotten into an argument with a speaker who organised events in their home country. I was beside the speaker, backing them up. The man before us insisted that just because we ran events that people met each other at, we did not have a community. It was merely a forum for people to engage with each other through a shared (Largely professional) interest.

He was correct. There was no community. It was by his design, scaring people off and refusing any ideas with no demonstrable "educational" value. There was no way to change his mind. I looked forward, and didn't see a future for myself in a group with no human touch, so I walked away.

In the months before COVID-19 forced the world indoors, I had been thinking [a lot about other people](../isolation-community/). I realised I had become more withdrawn after some bad experiences, and had avoided putting the kind of effort I used to put into relationships towards new people. 

I explained to a close friend that I wanted to do more. But that it was probably time for me to move on. Although dancing could be a good outlet for this desire, I was tired. Few had seen what I had seen, and any more investment in the scene felt like it would benefit a business - not build the community I imagined, and wanted.

My weekly busy night became free. A fortnight later, I visited a friend across the country - and days after that, everything was closed.
