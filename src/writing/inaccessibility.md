Website development was the first kind of programming I'd ever tried - I think
I was 13 or 14. With a year or two of unintentionally spamming internet
communities under my belt, I had been given an administrative position on a
forum, where I realised the website's team had control over its CSS.

I "researched" what cascading style sheets were. Then what HTML
was. Then what other forum software was available. Then what the difference between
shared hosting and a virtual private server was.

Most people I've spoken to who are largely self-taught have a similar story of
learning more and more things as they went along. One ugly point that stuck out
to me were ARIA attributes - they looked ugly and felt unnecessary, and made my
handwritten HTML take even longer to finish.

I've [previously written](../technology-dependence) about it, but I found out I'm
Dyslexic during my Leaving Certificate year, and by that point I had become much
better informed about software accessibility on a surface level.

It was only when I started my computer science degree that I was really exposed to
the full scope of software accessibility, and a video I randomly came across
ended up changing my perspective completely. It was [a talk by a developer
called Seren Davies](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9xXBYcWgCHA) who is also
Dyslexic about the fact that over-reliance on
[icon fonts](https://alistapart.com/article/the-era-of-symbol-fonts)
completely broke websites for her.

I had always considered accessibility an important part of my general knowledge,
but after comprehending the fact it applied to me I started to think of it more as
a moral imperative - if a relatively benign issue as web fonts could impact someone
so heavily, how much more worse could badly designed technology be for those with
more restrictive disabilities?

Like security, I realised the obstacle to overcome is the fact that
accessibility tends to be framed as a separate concern to learn instead of an
implicit part of overall design. You could reduce it to *"Being mindful of who is
using your software, how they are interacting with it, and designing for them".*

Which could apply to designing anything at all - the caveat being recognising
that some of your users will have disabilities, which is where universal design
comes into play. I have had the opportunity to talk to a handful of team leads
with design or development backgrounds, and have heard that many larger
companies do prioritise accessibility, but the story is usually the same.

People had at most a cursory education on accessibility (If at all), and needed
to learn it later as part of their job's responsibilies.  It required a
deliberate, secondary effort for them to learn how to make accessible software
outside of their academic experience in order to implement it at their
workplace.

During November 2018 I volunteered at [PyCon Ireland](https://python.ie/) and
was shocked to discover there were less than 10 people with a computer science
degree that were also uniquely qualified to teach Primary or Secondary level
education, and saw the working draft for the Leaving Certificate computer science
curriculum. It included basic website design and accessibility.

This was greatly reassuring, because I'm certain the longer you take to try to
teach someone a core concept, the less likely they will have the bandwidth to
implement it as part of their paradigm. In the dance community, I've seen
some instances where "Musicality" is taught as an intermediate level skill, but
from class one everyone is dancing to the same music.

There's an analogy in almost all skilled creative work where this collision
between culture and educational concerns takes place. But I think we could be
doing more - trying to read the
[Web Content Accessibility Guidelines](https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG20/) is a
herculean feat which requires you to break down all of the jargon contained
within before figuring out exactly where it applies and how to do so.

If you want people to learn something, make it as easy as possible for them to
take agency over educating themselves and begin applying the concepts quickly.
Otherwise, it's another barrier to entry which will have a knock-on effect
further down the line for all of the people they are responsible for.
