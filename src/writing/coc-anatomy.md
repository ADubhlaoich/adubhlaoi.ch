In 2017 I was part of a small team of people responsible for running [Frankie
in Dublin](http://frankieindublin.com/), a three day dance event commemorating
the 80th anniversary of Frankie Manning visting Dublin with the Cotton Club
Revue.

I took a break from organising events after it, and came to a
realisation that hadn't struck me before, despite organising events in
different capacities for years. Your responsibility as an organiser is **not**
booking venues, or teachers, or advertising, or answering emails.

*Your responsibility is shaping your community's culture.*

Everything else is everyday minutae - and you could direct someone else to do
it from the role of a coordinator, which was a lesson I also learned from the
event. But that's a separate thing to discuss.

Early on I decided that I wanted a code of conduct to be part of the event, as
although it was an uncommon artefact at Irish events at the time, I felt that
it was a non-negotiable requirement for me to continue being part of the team,
and I have since refused to work with or for anyone that does not have one.

Thankfully, nobody had any reason to object, and I got to work adopting an
existing document, namely the one from [Fair City
Blues](http://www.faircityblues.com/), another local event. I think if someone
were to trace a family tree for codes of conduct most would share the [Mobtown
Ballroom's](https://mobtownballroom.com/code) Code of Conduct as an ancestor.

I set out the following requirements for the code:  

* It needed to be thorough
* It needed to be easily understood
* And it needed to be concise

Some of this probably sounds contradictory, but it's not: write everything as
simply as possible in plain English, and cover only what is absolutely
necessary without compromising on the parts that are important.

[This is the code](https://adubhlaoich.github.io/dance-code-of-conduct/) that
came out of the effort. It's hosted on github, so you can browse through the
commit history to see how it has changed over time. It is designed to be easy
to follow, but also to adopt - as part of my research, I saw some very specific
requirements in other codes of conduct I disliked.

The only real mention of floorcraft in the code of conduct is at the end of the
document, but it isn't explicitly named - a new dancer might not know what the
word floorcraft even means, and it is a skill largely taught by teachers and
drilled from experience, so trying to ban it provides no wiggle room for
accidents or inexperience. Instead, it simply asks for politeness.

Other codes of conduct I've read included caveats about personal hygiene
(Nearly all of which are implicitly a given), or include inane attempts to
police how people dress, which I think is simultaneously disrespectful and
completely unnecessary.

The one thing I've been unsure about the code lacking is any kind of clause for
outside-event activity. Although it's not currently visible, I spotted
something on the [London Lindy
Exchange's](https://www.londonlindyexchange.com/) Code of Conduct about online
harrassment.

As an event organiser I would take steps to ban someone if I knew they were 
harassing others online, and I think the code is comprehensive enough to cover
out-of-venue breaches, but it could simply be a case of re-wording something
further for additional clarity.

Since the codes' conception, I have brought it with me to other events I have
been involved in, and locally it has been adopted by other organisers. The
second hurdle I've come across after convincing people to take it on is
encouraging them to put it somewhere people can actually see.

If the explicit purpose of a code of conduct is for your event attendees to
feel safe, then they need to be aware it exists. The two simplest ways I know
to make this happen are to either print out copies for people attending your
event, or to include it on its own page of your website.

Unfortunately, I have seen them hidden solely in the depths of registration
forms or their terms and conditions - if I'm making a decision on whether or
not to attend your class or workshop based on if you have a code or not, by
making it harder to find, I will never see it at all.
