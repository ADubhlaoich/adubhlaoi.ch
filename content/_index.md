# ADubhlaoich
Greetings. I’m Alan Dooley; as Gaélige Ailín O’Dubhlaoich is ainm dom; hence my online pseudonym, “ADubhlaoich”. My professional areas of interest are software accessibility, information security and technical writing.

I'm currently working as a DevOps Engineer, so a lot of what I'm actively learning revolves around Infrastructure as Code. However, it doesnt preclude me from continuing to try work a little bit on everything - including this website!

I tend to write about whatever takes my fancy, but if you'd like to see me write about something specific, shoot me a message. I'm trying to push myself to try building in public for all of my interests, tech and otherwise.
