Hello! If you're reading this, you're probably trying to figure out who I am,
and what I do. My name's Alan Dooley, as Gaélige Ailín Ó'Dubhlaoich is ainm
dom; hence my online psuedonym, "ADubhlaoich".

My professional areas of interest are software accessibility, information
security and technical writing. I consider all three similar in an abstract
sense, as all involve managing user expectations in some way.

I'm Dyslexic and Dysgraphic. They don't come up often thanks to technology, but
they inform a lot about my life - I was assessed right before I turned 18, and
I'm still trying to learn the nuances of how it affects my life. As a result, I
enjoy learning new skills and ways of approaching information.

Outside of "professional" work stuff I've also been adjacent to performing arts
in some capacity. I used to talk at storytelling events, then I got into circus
performance and finally swing dancing.

All of the stuff I do is linked together in some way. My opinions in my writing
may not reflect that of people I've worked with, but instead serve as a record
of what I've learned from involving myself in as many things as I can.

If you'd like to talk, you can contact me [at] adubhlaoich dot ie.
