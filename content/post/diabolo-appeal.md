Like most people starting out in the circus community, the first prop I
put some time towards was juggling balls. I'd been conscripted to join
the Trinity College Circus Society during their freshers week.

I spent the first two training sessions before the Tralee Circus Convention 
trying to work on the basic three ball cascade and managed to get it
"solid" days before the trip. "Solid" has very specific connotations for
prop manipulation.

Language can be very imprecise sometimes - I got some feedback on the
master copy of my CV recently, and I discussed the nature of the word
"comfortable" with the reviewer. 

I use it to describe the fact Python is my favourite programming
language, but in the context of professional work "comfortable" 
could mean that the person can write entire programs and libraries 
without much thought, or that they had followed a lot of tutorials 
and knew how to smartly google when problem-solving.

When it comes to training, circus has the terms "Flash", "Qualify" and
"Solid". To "Flash" a pattern or movement is to be able to do it once,
to "Qualify" it is to be able to do it twice, and to have it "Solid" is
to be able to run through the pattern as many times as there are
objects.

This might be a little confusing, so here's a concrete example - being
able to juggle a five ball cascade. A cascade is the most basic juggling
pattern possible, and involves throwing an odd amount of balls with an
alternating underside swooping pattern which forms an infinite symbol,
or sideways eight.

To "Flash" five balls you must be able to throw and catch each ball once,
making a full five ball rotation. To "Quality" five balls you must throw
and catch each ball twice, creating a ten ball rotation. However, to be
able to call the juggling pattern "Solid", it must be five throws and
catches for each ball, meaning it is a full rotation of 25. Taking an 
object as a variable, the variations are X, X * 2, and X * X.

Right before I arrived at Tralee I'd bought my first diabolo set, and
there I found three or four people working on the prop. It wasn't very
popular, which might have been appealing as form of vanity, and
unfortunately it still isn't.

A friend of mine, Caroline, who later got me into swing dancing,
suggested that the reason diabolo is unpopular is because it's not
directly tactile. It's easy to dismiss it due to its difficulty, but
that's focusing on the symptom; how it feels is the actual problem. You
very rarely touch the main part of the prop.
