In early December, I found out Smashing Magazine was [offering copies of a
new book](https://twitter.com/smashingmag/status/1201792021209501698) through
the accessibility channel of a local Slack team. 

During a meetup a few months prior I realised I was unsure of the best 
practices for building or testing components for accessibility, and wanted an 
excuse to work on my JavaScript - so I sent a message requesting a copy.

To make a long review short, this is an amazing book, and I recommend you get
it no matter what level of experience you might have. I read through it from
the perspective of someone who tries to code with accessibility in mind, but is
largely self taught. The author, [Heydon Pickering](https://heydonworks.com/),
completely changed my perspective on how most common interactive elements on 
websites should be coded.

For a multitude of reasons I've always felt allergic to JavaScript due to my
split time doing front and back-end development - I've tried to do as much as
possible in HTML & CSS alone and genuinely hadn't realised the possibilities
JavaScript opened up to make a website more accessible until I read this book.

Heydon explains things with authority and simplicity I have rarely seen for any
technical subject in or outside of formal education. I err on the side of
skepticism when most people try to give imperative advice; it is rarely self
evident or is as broad as throwing dynamite in a bucket.

This book broke down every example of an interactive component I could think of
on a web page, and even made important distinctions I had never considered 
(Such as in the "Menus and Menu Buttons" chapter).

Heydon introduces a component on a conceptual level, then gives an example of 
how it's commonly implemented. He then explains the pros and the cons, and
offers an alternative, progressively building upon each component for  edge
cases. 

The explanations are thorough, but they themselves never become
inaccessible; everything is told through plain English.

Every component examined is accompanied by juxtaposed illustrations and code
blocks, with footnotes providing shortlinks to working examples of the
aforementioned components implemented with accessibility considerations.

The book itself feels nice to hold, and is well designed. The typography makes
it easy to read, with comfortable text size, generous spacing and short
paragraphs. I never felt like I was experiencing visual fatigue as I read it; I
only stopped to reflect or write notes.

I have only two criticisms, and both may be literal mistakes fixed in a later
edition. In summary, it's a really good book and I will be deferring to it for
a long time until its lessons have been internalised in my mind and in my code.
